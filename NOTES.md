cant use docker. i think

see what other types look like
has a lot of stuff, but need it
its fine

```dart

enabledBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
    borderRadius:
        BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(100)),
    borderSide:
        BorderSide(color: Colors.greenAccent)),
focusedBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
    borderRadius:
        BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(100)),
    borderSide:
        BorderSide(color: Colors.greenAccent)),
```

i have to give container. they give an element to put in it

https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Autocomplete-class.html
could use the apple thing, but this is exactly what i was thinking
and i can do it async

i want `Autocomplete - async, debouncing, and network errors`, but wholey code
i will do basic for now. then not do request for the list
actually it should be stored on system. and keep it there, for a while

seems to be known, but its only on mobile from my view point

bottom: 0,
            width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
            height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,

oh, its a neg trans issue. but it still doesnt exist for desktop

why was it neg neg
made progress. but still doesnt seem right

oh the offset is at the page level. not where it was
it thinks its at the top
i did it!!!!! no idea how !!!!!!

1. all in stack
2. transform in position with bottom 0
3. works for me `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
... but it is a bug

new idea will be different, so just try taht now
should be fine and easier

i could use dropdown with dropdown menuitem,
but it gets in the way. it wouldnt work for end goal
i want dropdown input, so might as well test on it.
should work differently, so just use that
yeah, not gonna use it so whatever

should try for scanning. maybe i can get category from it
but this is fine for starrting

this is better, but should do a raw, for control, and add the nodes to the gesture group

make category look better
make the buttons look better
