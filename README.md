see what other types look like
has a lot of stuff, but need it
its fine

```dart

enabledBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
    borderRadius:
        BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(100)),
    borderSide:
        BorderSide(color: Colors.greenAccent)),
focusedBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
    borderRadius:
        BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(100)),
    borderSide:
        BorderSide(color: Colors.greenAccent)),
```

i have to give container. they give an element to put in it

https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Autocomplete-class.html
could use the apple thing, but this is exactly what i was thinking
and i can do it async

i want `Autocomplete - async, debouncing, and network errors`, but wholey code
i will do basic for now. then not do request for the list
actually it should be stored on system. and keep it there, for a while

seems to be known, but its only on mobile from my view point

bottom: 0,
            width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
            height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,

oh, its a neg trans issue. but it still doesnt exist for desktop

why was it neg neg
made progress. but still doesnt seem right

oh the offset is at the page level. not where it was
it thinks its at the top
i did it!!!!! no idea how !!!!!!

1. all in stack
2. transform in position with bottom 0
3. works for me `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
